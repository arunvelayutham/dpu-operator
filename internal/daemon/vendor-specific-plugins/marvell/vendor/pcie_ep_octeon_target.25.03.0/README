The purpose of the PCIe-EP (Endpoint) extension is to facilitate packet I/O
between any host and an Octeon CN9K or CN10K (referered collectively as CNXK) connected to that host in PCIe EP mode.

This README gives overview of instructions to build and run PCIe EP extension
on CNXK platform.

This repo contains Marvell Octeon Target side software components for reference and sample usage.

Overview
========
The purpose of the software in this repo relates mainly to enable, support (and exist in)
Octeon CN9K or CN10K (referered collectively as CNXK or the target) connected to a host in PCIe Endpoint mode.
All the components in this repo is intended to run on the Octeon card, and provides a reference
implementation for a "control plane" intended to help the card run in the PCIe Endpoint mode in congruence with
the Host side PCIe Endpoint Drivers


Octep CP Library
================

This library intends to provide a framework for application software, to interact with necessary functionalities
related to the Octeon working in EP mode. The functionalities include an interface and a control protocol to communicate
with the PCIe EP host drivers out of band, using a part of the BAR4 memory of the card.

Octep CP Agent
==============

The octep_cp_agent application provides a reference or a default implementation, which utilizes the
octep_cp_library API interface to bringup and maintain a control plane, to support the Octeon's EP functionalities.

Build procedures
================

Please refer to the individual component README in their respective folder for individual building procedures.
