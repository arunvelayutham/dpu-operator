LIB_DIR is location of library source code

```bash

  cd $LIB_DIR
  make
```

In environments where the marvell provided OOT PEM kernel driver (pcie-marvell-cnxk-ep.ko)
is not available, the VFIO driver solution can be enabled in the library.

Note: The VFIO-PCI driver solution is currently available only for cn106xx.

To enable this solution, add USE_PEM_AND_DPI_PF=1 to CFLAGS to compile support for PEM and DPI PF vfio drivers in:
```bash

	export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -DUSE_PEM_AND_DPI_PF=1"
	make
```

Optional parameters for make are

- PLAT=<aarch64(default)/x86_64>


Following artifacts will be available in ``LIB_DIR``:

- Libraries liboctep_cp.a and liboctep_cp.so
